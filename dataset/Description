## Dataset Description
Each season there are thousands of NCAA basketball games played between Division I college basketball teams, culminating in March Madness®, the 68-team national championship that starts in the middle of March. We have provided a large amount of historical data about college basketball games and teams, going back many years. Armed with this historical data, you can explore it and develop your own distinctive ways of predicting March Madness® game outcomes. You can even evaluate and compare different approaches by seeing which of them would have done best at predicting tournament games from the past.

If you are unfamiliar with the format and intricacies of the NCAA® tournament, we encourage reading the wikipedia pages for the men's and women's tournaments before before diving into the data.  The data description and schema may seem daunting at first, but is not as complicated as it appears.

Please note that in previous years, there were separate competitions for predicting the men's tournament games or the women's tournament games. That changed last year. Once again, you will be submitting combined prediction files that include predictions for both the men's tournament and the women's tournament. Thus the data files incorporate both men's data and women's data. The files that pertain only to men's data will start with the letter prefix M, and the files that pertain only to women's data will start with the letter prefix W. Some files span both men's and women's data, such as Cities and Conferences, and these files do not start with an M prefix or a W prefix.

As a reminder, you are encouraged to incorporate your own sources of data. We have provided extensive historical data to jump-start the modeling process, and this data is self-consistent (for instance, dates and team ID's are always treated the same way). Nevertheless, you may also be able to make productive use of external data. If you head down this path, please be forewarned that many sources have their own distinctive way of identifying the names of teams, and this can make it challenging to link up with our data. The MTeamSpellings and WTeamSpellings files, which are listed in the bottom section below, may help you map external team references into our own Team ID structure, and you may also need to understand exactly how dates work in our data.

We extend our gratitude to Kenneth Massey for providing much of the historical data.

Special Acknowledgment to Jeff Sonas of Sonas Consulting for his support in assembling the dataset for this competition.

Code Requirements
Please note that this is a Code Competition. You will submit a notebook that produces a portfolio of bracket predictions for both the Men's and Women's tournaments.

During the submission phase of the competition, we provide a 2024_tourney_seeds.csv file that actually contains the seeds from 2023 and will score your submissions against the 2023 tournament results. After Selection Sunday, when the competition has closed, we will replace this file with the actual 2024 tournament selections and rescore your submissions against the 2024 results.

You may find details of the submission format and evaluation metric on the Evaluation page.

File descriptions
Below we describe the format and fields of the competition data files. All of the files are complete through February 14th of the current season. As we get closer to the tournament, we will periodically provide updates to these files to incorporate data from the remaining weeks of the current season.
